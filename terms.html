All controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and us arising out of, under, or related in any way to this Agreement or our privacy practices, shall exclusively be settled through binding arbitration.</span></li>

The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). As modified by this Agreement, and unless agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively &ldquo;Rules and Procedures&rdquo;).</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: #323a3e; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</span></li>

Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration provision. Such claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the state courts located in New York, NY or the federal courts located in New York, NY. Additionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</span></li>

If, however, either subpart (d) or (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration. In the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and us shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts specified in subsection &ldquo;(d)&rdquo; above.</span></li>
